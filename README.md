# Lists(?)
I have finished writing the doubly-linked list, due to lack of interest after months of working on it, currently the most usable implementation is the C++ version, on the `cpp` branch. The `rust` branch contains a prototype that was the cause for me stopping, as I couldn't be bothered to write any more code for this. I will now start on an implementation of a Vector in C, which I will perhaps port to Rust.
~~A very bad doubly linked list library I'm writing as a learning exercise, that might become a collection of list-like data structures soon. The master branch is written in C, but there is a work in progress C++ version on the `cpp` branch. The C++ version is halfway between C with classes and full on C++, for I've tried to keep the C feel, not using `std::string` etc, but it uses exceptions and has operator overloading, so it's nearing a point where I might start using the C++ stl. Both versions are currently riddled with logic bugs, which means that often the list will become invalid, but I'm working on fixing those. Once those are finished I might start on a proper Rust implementation, which I haven't done yet because of an abundance of double free bugs in my original (private) Rust version.~~

I don't really know C (or C++, and my Rust is quite rusty) so please excuse any bad code, although don't hesitate to suggest improvements!
