# C doubly linked list
A very bad doubly linked list library(?) I wrote in C.

The Makefile was written using a combination of ChatGPT and internet guides, so it may not be great. If you can see any problems, please open an issue to notify me. :)

I don't know C so please excuse any bad code, although don't hesitate to suggest improvements!
