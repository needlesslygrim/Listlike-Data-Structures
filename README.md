# ~~C~~C++ doubly linked list
A very bad doubly linked list library? I wrote in ~~C~~C++ (I rewrote it for fun). The C++ version is actually completely broken, and I don't really feel like trying to figure out what's wrong since I *prefer* C.

I don't know ~~C~~C++ so please excuse any bad code, although don't hesitate to suggest improvements!
